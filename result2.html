        It's a Jeep thing... You understand<br>
        You are offically a Jeep guy, congratulations. You are someone who wants to spend every weekend climbing rocks in the Cascades or<br>
        going to Moab. You are seen as the runt compared to other off roaders, like the Toyota Land Cruiser, the Mercedes G-Class and the <br>
        Land Rover Range Rover. But you chose a Jeep because it was a cheaper altenative to those options, cheaper to work on, and more importantly <br>
        easier to keep running. Becuase at the end of the day, if you where up north of Sedro-Wooley and your thermostat pooped out. You would <br>
        have better chances finding a new one in that area compared to the others. So embrace it my friend you are a Jeep guy.
