        Bro Truck<br>
        You are a strong individual, you are someone who visits body building forums at least 4 times a day. You purposely <br>
        wear tight polo shirts like it is still 2006 and you want to be seen in something that expresses who you are to everyone <br> 
        when you are on the freeway. You decide that you need a truck, but not just any truck, a used Dodge Cummins 2500. You buy <br>
        this truck because it's body has muscular features like you have on yourself, its either a loud color like red or dark color <br>
        like black, and most importantly Dodge trucks are cheaper on the second hand market compared to products offered by General <br>
        Motors and Ford.
