        You are a Camaro man<br>
        What can be said about this except you are a true patriot. A Chevrolet Camaro is as American as Apple Pie and fireworks on the <br>
        fourth of July. You are someone who loves performance but doesn't care about going around corners safely. This is because in America <br>
        there is only one type of car racing, its NASCAR and they only focus on straight line speed and the occasional left turn. You are someone <br>
        who lives in the country now or will be living in the country soon. An ideal date night for you and your partner would be to visit one of <br>
        three privately owned restraunts in town, or the local Olive Garden next to the Interstate. You have a six disc CD changer in your Camaro <br>
        and at least one of the CDs in it is a Bob Seger CD, most likely the Night Moves album. You are also the type of person that would spend <br>
        every Sunday, rain or shine, washing and vacuuming his Camaro.
