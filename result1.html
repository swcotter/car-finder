        You are a Porsche Guy
        You might think you are a Ferrari guy, or a Lambogini guy but at the end of the day you are a Porsche guy.<br>
        Ever since you saw that first episode of Top Gear on BBC America of Jeremy Clarkson sliding a supercar, while he yells "POWER"<br>
        You have had dreams of wanting to do the same thing. You could buy a Mazda Miata but then you would be the slow car on the track.<br>
        With a Porsche you would not only be competeive with everyone else at the local track day, but you would also have years of Porsche<br>
        racing heritage backing you up. The only downside of being a Porsche guy is the cost of entry both on the new and second hand market <br>
        and the cost of repairing your Porsche when you eventually break it because you tried to show off to your buddies one night.<br>
