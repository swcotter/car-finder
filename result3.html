        You like the idea of lowering heavily depreciated luxury or sport cars so low to the ground that you bottom it out everytime you try to enter <br>
        the Ballard Fred Meyer parking lot. You are the type of person that will see warning lights on your instrument cluster and simply igrnore them. <br>
        Even though these cars are extremely impractiable and not fun to drive, you will still choose to drive them every day to your nomral job. A job <br>
        in which 75% of your paycheck will end up going to making sure your stanced out Subaru will still be able to make it to the vape store. <br>
